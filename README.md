# ocr
This is an Open Source project

It does Optical Character Reading on images.


This Tool makes use of Tesseract SDK.

I have implemented it in php Laravel Framework.

Alot is still going on regarding the project, with the aim to;
    1. Have a usable UI
    2. Have a RESTFUL endpoint to read characters through API calls.
 
 
 Enjoy It!
